# IPL-Insights
Cricket is a very famous game played in India and IPL is an annual all star league for cricketers from all around the globe. This program tries to analyse data from 2008 to 2016. This is a game like baseball which is played with 22 players - 11 each side. The side which wins the toss chooses to either bat or bowl and the other team does vice versa.

Here we take the IPL dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl) and try to find the data insights like, most number of matches per season, number of matches won by each team, top match winners in the team, best team by won by most run and wicket margin, team won by minimum run or wicket margin, etc.

Kindly let me know if you need more help on this.
